# Prerequisites

In this lab, you will review the prerequisites required to complete all additional labs.

## Installations

### Code Editor
With this being a DevOps journey, a suitable code editor is required. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), which is a free code editor.

### Terraform

[Terraform Download](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

### Docker
To build the Docker image, you can use Docker Desktop for Windows or MacOS.

## Azure setup

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have an Azure account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free 12 month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/search/?&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwtrSLBhCLARIsACh6RmiaUvnIcRuC0BE8HVqtnC09Za6Y_ByYHH8Z4qHmK5-inXXdgZB3d1EaAh8EEALw_wcB:G:s&OCID=AID2200274_SEM_Cj0KCQjwtrSLBhCLARIsACh6RmiaUvnIcRuC0BE8HVqtnC09Za6Y_ByYHH8Z4qHmK5-inXXdgZB3d1EaAh8EEALw_wcB:G:s&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtrSLBhCLARIsACh6RmiaUvnIcRuC0BE8HVqtnC09Za6Y_ByYHH8Z4qHmK5-inXXdgZB3d1EaAh8EEALw_wcB).

You should know that the tutorial for *DevOps The Hard Way* will cost money because some of the services that you use in Azure will not be part of the free tier.
