# Deploy sample Application to Container Registry

This lab is to deploy the same Application to Container Registry

1. The Docker image can be built and ran locally to test - see [here](docker-image-locally.md)

2. We want to run this Docker build and publish directly to the created Azure Container Registry in lab 2. 

3. Create a new service connection for ACR access.
   - Within your Azure DevOps Project â€“ select **Project Settings**
   - Select **Service Connections** -> **Docker Registry** -> Select registry type: **Azure Container Registry**
   - Select correct ACR and create service connection name. I have given devopsjourneyacr.azurecr.io as my service connection name
