# Testing infrastructure

The purpose of this lab is to look at how you can test your infrastructure. 

In this lab, you will:
- Use Inspec-Azure to test your Azure Resources
- Run Inspec-Tests using Azure DevOps

Please Note:- There is currently an issue regarding running Inspec-Azure - please see how to resolve here: https://github.com/inspec/inspec-azure/issues/592

I have raised a PR to fix the issue: https://github.com/inspec/inspec-azure/pull/605 Once this has been merged, inspec testing will run successful again in Azure DevOps within this lab. 

temporary run the inspec tests locally.
